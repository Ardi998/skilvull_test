Sure, here are the working instructions for the entire system using Python Flask for the backend and React JS for the frontend:

### Backend Working Instructions (Python Flask):

#### 1. Environment Setup:
   - Make sure Python is installed on your system.
   - Use `pip` to install Flask by running the command `pip install flask`.

#### 2. Create Flask Project:
   - Create a new directory for your Flask project.
   - Inside the directory, create a file named `app.py` as the main file for the Flask application.

#### 3. Create API Endpoint:
   - In the `app.py` file, create an endpoint for product prediction.
   - Receive data from the frontend, such as `customer_id`, `page_views`, and `time_spent`.
   - Perform prediction process and send the result back to the frontend.

#### 4. Run Flask Server:
   - Ensure you have added code to run the Flask server at the end of the `app.py` file.
   - Run the server using the command `python app.py`.

### Frontend Working Instructions (React JS):

#### 1. Environment Setup:
   - Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.

#### 2. Create React Project:
   - Use `create-react-app` or another method to create a React project.
   - Navigate to the newly created React project directory.

#### 3. Create React Component:
   - Create the main component for your application. For example, `App.js`.

#### 4. Design User Interface:
   - Inside the `App.js` component, design the user interface with HTML elements and CSS or using libraries like Bootstrap.

#### 5. Send Requests to Backend:
   - When the user fills the form and presses the "Predict" button, send a request to the backend endpoint you created using `fetch` or libraries like Axios.

#### 6. Display Prediction Results:
   - Receive the response from the backend and display the prediction result to the user.

#### 7. Manage State and Side Effects:
   - Use `useState` to manage local state like `customerID`, `pageViews`, and `timeSpent`.
   - Use `useEffect` to perform actions such as clearing previous prediction results.

#### 8. Run React Application:
   - Use the command `npm start` to run the React application.
   - The application will run locally and can be accessed through the browser.




### Flow process of Flask Python program (Backend):

**Initializing Flask Application:**

1. The Flask application is initialized using `Flask(__name__)`.
2. Debug mode is enabled with `app.debug = True` to facilitate troubleshooting during development.

**Handling CORS:**

1. The CORS middleware from the flask_cors library is used to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy. This allows requests from different domains.

**Loading Data:**

1. Customer data (`customer_interactions`), product details (`product_details`), and purchase history (`purchase_history`) are loaded from CSV files using pandas.

**Data Merging:**

1. Customer data and purchase history are merged based on `customer_id` using the merge function.

**Feature Extraction:**

1. Relevant features for prediction are extracted from the merged data as independent variables (X) and dependent variables (y).

**Train-Test Data Splitting:**

1. Data is split into training and testing datasets using train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.

**Model Training:**

1. The RandomForestClassifier model from sklearn.ensemble is used to train the training data.
2. The model is fitted to the training data using the fit method.

**Saving Model to Disk:**

1. The trained model is saved to disk as the 'model.pkl' file using joblib.dump.

**Loading Model from Disk:**

1. The trained model is then loaded back from disk using joblib.load.

**Handling HTTP Requests:**

1. There are two endpoints:
   - '/' is the endpoint for the home page, which returns the message 'This is the home page'.
   - '/predict' is the endpoint that accepts POST requests to make predictions.
2. When a POST request is received at the '/predict' endpoint:
   - JSON data containing `customer_id`, `page_views`, and `time_spent` is extracted from the request.
   - The validity of `customer_id` is checked.
   - Product prediction is made using the loaded model.
   - Product information predicted is extracted from the `product_details` data.
   - The prediction result is returned as a JSON response.

**Error Handling:**

1. Errors that may occur during this process are handled by returning the appropriate JSON response.

**Running the Flask Application:**

1. The Flask application is run using `app.run()`.

Thus, this Flask program provides a service for predicting products based on customer and product data using a pre-trained model.




### Flow process of React JS program (Frontend):

1. **Component Loading**:
   - When the application is loaded, the `App` component will be initialized.

2. **State Initialization**:
   - Initial state for `customerID`, `pageViews`, `timeSpent`, `predictedProduct`, and `error` is set using the `useState` hook.
   - The component is rendered using these initial values.

3. **Initial Effect**:
   - The `useEffect` effect is used to remove previous prediction results from local storage (`localStorage`) when the component is loaded.

4. **User Input**:
   - Users input values for `customerID`, `pageViews`, and `timeSpent` through input elements.

5. **Handle Predict**:
   - When the user clicks the "Predict" button, the `handlePredict` function is called.

6. **Validation Check**:
   - The `handlePredict` function checks if `customerID` has been entered. If not, an error message is set in the `error` state, and the prediction result is cleared.

7. **HTTP Request**:
   - If `customerID` is valid, the `handlePredict` function makes an HTTP POST request to the `/predict` endpoint on the local Flask server.
   - JSON data containing `customer_id`, `page_views`, and `time_spent` is sent to the server.

8. **Response Handling**:
   - If the server response is OK, prediction data is processed from the JSON response and stored in the `predictedProduct` state. Any errors that occur during this process are captured and displayed to the user.
   - If the response is not OK, errors from the response are retrieved and displayed to the user.

9. **Local Storage**:
   - Prediction results are also stored in local storage (`localStorage`) along with a timestamp for future reference.

10. **Page Refresh**:
    - The page is automatically refreshed after 5 minutes to provide a fresh experience.
    - The `setTimeout` function is used to set the refresh time.

11. **UI Update**:
    - If prediction results are available, the UI is updated to display the predicted product information.
    - If there are errors, error messages are displayed to the user.

Thus, the workflow of this React program enables users to input customer information, make product predictions, and display prediction results or errors that may occur during the process.
